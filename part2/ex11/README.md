Mapbox provides a basic example for a React based Mapbox app: https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-react-examples/tree/master/basic.

With the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` presented here, one can test it on http://localhost:3000/ via `docker compose up`, without the need to install dependencies locally.

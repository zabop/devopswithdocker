# Brief description

I created [gpkgtogeojson.com](https://gpkgtogeojson.com/). I deployed it to [fly.io](https://fly.io/). You can upload a GPKG file, and it gives you back a GeoJSON file. [Here](https://github.com/zabop/devopswithdockerpart1/raw/master/exercise1_16/example.gpkg) is an example GPKG file. One can make sure the conversion is indeed correct by visualizing both files in QGIS.
